brew install --cask lap
```

### macOS Manual Install (Apple Silicon / Intel)

2. Install it with your package manager or run `sudo apt install ./Lap_0.3.2_amd64.deb` (x64) or `sudo apt install ./Lap_0.3.2_arm64.deb` (ARM64).
3. Launch **Lap** from your applications menu.

For better video playback support on Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint, install:

```bash
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
```

### Linux AppImage (x64 / ARM64)

1. Download the `_amd64.AppImage` (x64) or `_aarch64.AppImage` (ARM64) file from the [latest release](https://github.com/julyx10/lap/releases/latest).
2. Make it executable in your file manager, or run `chmod +x Lap_0.3.2_amd64.AppImage` using the filename you downloaded.

### Windows 10/11 (x64 / ARM64)

1. Download the latest `_x64_en-US.msi` or `_arm64_en-US.msi` installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/julyx10/lap/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer and complete the setup wizard.
3. Launch **Lap** from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

Lap's Windows installer is currently unsigned. If Microsoft SmartScreen blocks the download or installer, choose **Keep anyway** or **More info** > **Run anyway**.

## First Run

When you open Lap for the first time:

1.  **Grant Permissions**: Lap needs access to your folders to display photos.
2.  **Add an Album**: Add a folder containing your photos to your library.
3.  **Let it Index**: Lap will scan your files, generate thumbnails, and build local search data. This happens on your device.

## Import and Explore

- Use **Import…** from an album's context menu to copy media into date-organized folders while preserving filenames and skipping duplicate content.
- Switch to **Map View** from the main toolbar to explore geotagged media matching your current filters. Map tiles require an internet connection.
- Adjust thumbnail quality and the RAW thumbnail source in **Settings → Advanced**.

## Updating Lap

On macOS and Windows, use the built-in updater or install the latest package over your existing installation. For Linux DEB installations, install the latest matching DEB package with your package manager.

For AppImage installations, download the new AppImage instead of using the built-in updater. Version 0.3.2 includes embedded update information and companion `.zsync` files for future delta updates through compatible external tools such as AppImageUpdate.

See the [v0.3.2 release notes](/guide/release-notes/v0.3.2) for the latest changes.
