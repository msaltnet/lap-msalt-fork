Lap is an open-source, local-first photo manager for browsing family albums, finding old photos quickly, and managing large personal media libraries offline.
It is a privacy-focused alternative to cloud photo services: no forced upload, local AI search, folder-first workflow, and free to use.

## Why Lap

- **Local-first by design**: your photos stay on your own disk, with no required cloud account or upload.
- **No library lock-in**: work directly with your existing folders instead of importing everything into a closed database.
- **Private AI tools**: search, similarity, smart tags, and face features run locally on your machine.
- **Built for large collections**: optimized for smooth browsing and organization across libraries with 100k+ files.
- **Open source and free**: no subscription, no forced ecosystem, and code you can inspect.

## Features

- **Flexible library browsing** with timeline, folder, location, camera, lens, tag, favorite, rating, subject, and face filters.
- **Smart Albums** save rule-based views with custom grouping, sorting, ordering.
- **Collections**: Organize files into flexible collections without moving or duplicating the originals.
- **Local AI search** for text prompts, visual similarity, subjects, face clustering, and optional multilingual search in 50+ languages.
- **Optional local AI captions** describe selected photos with a separately installed, OpenAI-compatible vision model and make those descriptions searchable in Lap.
- **Apple Live Photos** recognize paired HEIC/MOV Live Photos, play them in the viewer, and keep linked MOV and AAE sidecars together during rename, move, copy, and delete operations.
- **RAW + JPEG/HEIC pairs** optionally group a RAW file and its same-named JPEG or HEIC companion in the same folder as one item. The originals remain separate files, while rename, move, copy, paste, and delete operations keep the pair together.
- **Folder-first workflow** with multiple libraries, drag-and-drop import, copy-paste import, filesystem sync, and safe move/copy/delete operations.
- **Culling and comparison tools** including a four-pane image comparison viewer.
- **Cleanup tools** to find duplicates and batch move unwanted files to trash.
- **Built-in editing** for crop, rotate, flip, resize, and basic image adjustments.
- **Broad format support** for 60+ photo, RAW, and video formats.

### Optional local AI captions

Lap can generate a one-sentence description for the current photo or a selected group of photos and RAW files. The feature is off by default and requires a separately installed OpenAI-compatible vision runtime, such as [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.com/api/openai-compatibility) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/developer/rest). Lap does not install, download, or start a caption model.

For example, with Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3:4b
ollama serve
```

Then open **Settings → Search → AI captions**, enable the feature, and set:

- Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`
- Model: `gemma3:4b`

For privacy, Lap accepts caption endpoints on `localhost` or another loopback address only, bypasses system proxies, and does not follow redirects. A resized preview is sent only to the local runtime when you explicitly generate a caption; there is no automatic whole-library captioning. Generated captions stay in Lap's local database, appear in unified text search, and are not embedded in the original file or written to a sidecar.

## Metadata, Collections, and Moving Files

Lap is folder-first, but not every piece of information shown in Lap is embedded in the original file. This distinction matters when you also manage the same folders in Finder, Explorer, or another photo app.

### What stays with the file

- Your original photos and videos always remain ordinary files in their existing folders.
- File metadata already embedded in a file, such as EXIF capture date, camera, lens, GPS, and orientation, is read from that file when Lap indexes it.
- Saving a built-in image edit writes the resulting image to the selected destination.
- When you rename, move, copy, or delete files **in Lap**, Lap updates its local catalog at the same time. It also keeps supported grouped assets, such as Apple Live Photo components, AAE sidecars, and enabled RAW + JPEG/HEIC pairs, together.

### What is stored locally by Lap

The following are Lap library data. They are stored in Lap's local database or library configuration, not written into EXIF, IPTC, or XMP sidecars:

- Collections, Tags, Comments, Favorites, Ratings, and Culling states (including Picks and Rejects)
- Smart Albums and their rules, grouping, sorting, and ordering
- AI captions, AI search data, face data, thumbnails, and other index/cache data

This data does not travel with a file when it is copied, exported, or moved outside Lap, and it is not available automatically to other applications.

### Working with files outside Lap

Lap can rescan folders and detect many filesystem changes. But changes made outside Lap—such as renaming, moving, replacing, or copying files—can disrupt organization that is stored only in Lap.

For the most reliable results, rename and move files in Lap whenever you rely on Collections, Tags, Comments, Favorites, Ratings, or culling states. If you also manage files outside Lap, back up Lap's database and configuration together with your photos. You can manage the database location and create a backup in **Settings → Storage**.

Deleting Lap's database or configuration removes this local organization and index data, but does not delete your original media files.

## Uninstall Lap

Lap works directly with your existing photo folders. Uninstalling Lap, or deleting its database and cache files, does **not** delete your original photos.

The standard uninstall steps remove the application. To remove Lap completely, quit Lap first, uninstall the application, then delete its local database, thumbnail cache, and configuration files using the cleanup command for your platform.

### macOS

If you installed Lap with Homebrew:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask lap
```

For a manual installation, quit Lap and move `Lap.app` from the `Applications` folder to the Trash.

To remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/Library/WebKit/com.julyx10.lap"
rm -f "$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.julyx10.lap.plist"
```

### Windows

Open **Settings > Apps > Installed apps**, find **Lap**, and select **Uninstall**.

Then open PowerShell and remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\com.julyx10.lap"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue "$env:APPDATA\com.julyx10.lap"
```

### Linux

For Debian-based distributions, uninstall the package:

```bash
sudo apt remove lap
```

Then remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/.local/share/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/.cache/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/.config/com.julyx10.lap"
```

If you selected a custom database storage directory in Lap settings, delete that directory separately after confirming that it contains only Lap database files.
